# From Open Source User to Fedora Contributor

I started my open source journey when I got my first laptop. It was old and slow but I needed it for school so I started looking into how to fix this.

## My Introduction to Linux

While looking around I was told I could use Linux, a free operating system that runs well on older hardware.

I decided to dip my toes into the Linux world by installing [Puppy Linux](https://puppylinux-woof-ce.github.io/), a tiny Linux distro that I knew my laptop could handle.

The experience was amazing; I was blown away at how fast and efficient my laptop became. This initial success sparked my interest in learning more about Linux and open source software.

## Discovering Open Source Software

Since I was a Windows user before, I had no idea about open source software. I was also broke so all I knew was the endless cycle of looking for cracked versions of tools I needed which honestly felt wrong to me.

Playing around on the small Linux distro had me discovering a wealth of free and open source alternatives to the proprietary software I was used to. I was amazed to find powerful tools like GIMP for image editing, LibreOffice for productivity and Blender for 3D modeling all for free. This was liberating; I no longer had to rely on shady sources for software.

When I was introduced to the concept of open source I was fascinated by the idea that anyone could contribute to software development. The notion that I could not only use but also help improve the software I loved was incredible.

## Getting Involved in the Fedora Project

Since Linux makes it so easy to code I started learning various programming languages and eventually started contributing to open source projects.

I also distro hopped a lot and found myself using [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) as my daily driver. Been using it for a while now and love how stable and polished it is.

Anyway, once I saw that [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) was looking for Fedora contributors I decided to apply. There were a lot of skilled contributors to the project I had applied to, but I was determined to learn and contribute. I am now working on improving Fedora's release schedule management by transitioning to something more functional and efficient.

The project can be found on Codeberg: [Fedora Release Schedule](https://codeberg.org/fedora/release-schedule-planner).

My plan is to learn as much as I can from my experienced mentor and engage as much as I can with all the other open source contributors regardless of the project they're on. I will learn from the experience and shar with others so as to get more people involved with free and open source software.

## Conclusion

My journey from an open source user to a Fedora contributor has been incredibly rewarding. I have learned so much about Linux, open source software, and the importance of community. I am excited to continue my contributions to the Fedora Project and help make it even better.
