# Building Responsive Web Components

Web components are a powerful way to create reusable UI elements that work across different frameworks and applications. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore how to build responsive web components that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.

## Why Web Components?

Web components offer several advantages:

- **Framework independence**: Work with React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript
- **Encapsulation**: Styles and behavior are isolated from the rest of the page
- **Reusability**: Once created, can be used anywhere
- **Standards-based**: Built on web platform APIs

## Creating Responsive Components

The key to responsive web components lies in:

1. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Use modern layout techniques
2. **Container queries**: Respond to component size, not viewport size
3. **Relative units**: Use rem, em, and percentages
4. **Media queries**: Traditional responsive breakpoints

```javascript
class ResponsiveCard extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.innerHTML = `
      <style>
        :host {
          display: block;
          container-type: inline-size;
        }
        
        @container (min-width: 300px) {
          .card {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: row;
          }
        }
      </style>
      <div class="card">
        <slot></slot>
      </div>
    `;
  }
}

customElements.define("responsive-card", ResponsiveCard);
```
