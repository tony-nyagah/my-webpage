# Diabetes Progression Predictor

A machine learning application that helps healthcare professionals and researchers predict diabetes progression using patient data and clinical indicators. Built with modern ML practices and deployed using containerization.

## Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses advanced machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes progression
- **Interactive Interface**: Web-based interface for easy data input and result visualization
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for seamless integration with healthcare systems
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based deployment for consistent environments
- **Automated Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask/FastAPI
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Docker, GitHub Container Registry
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization

## Machine Learning Approach

The predictor uses [describe your ML approach - e.g., regression models, feature engineering, cross-validation, etc.]

## Deployment

The application is containerized and available as a Docker image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tony-nyagah/diabetes-progression-predictor:latest
```

## Live Demo
